## Learning Markdown

Vanilla text may contain *italics* and **bold words**.

This paragraph is separated from the previous one by a blank line.
Line breaks  
are caused by two trailing spaces at the end of a line.

## More info on the lesson
You can find this lesson [here](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/jekyll-pages-novice/).

### Four reasons you should learn Markdown:

1. Less formatting than HTML
2. Easy to read even with formatting
3. Commonly used for websites and software development
4. We ~~don't~~ use it in The Carpentries

### Things to learn today:

- Write Markdown
- Host my first website on GitHub
- Learn about Jekyll
- Think about how my work group could benefit from what I have learned.

#### Example of nested lists:

- A list of items
- can be
  - deeply
    - nested
- returning to the top-level like this.

2. Enumerations can start at any number but
3. continue to increase in steps of one
4. even if the numbering does not. This updates the rendered numbering to avoid gaps when individual items are deleted.

#### Adding codes:

You can reference code `message='Hello World'`
or commands `git status` inside text.
Larger code snippets look like this:
```
print('Hello World')
```
```python
print("Hello everyone!")
```

#### Sample syntax highlighting:

R:
```r
print(paste("How","are","you?"), quote = FALSE)
```

Python:
```python
s = "How are you?"
print(s)
```

HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<a href=https://carpentries.org/>This is a link</a>
</body>
</html>
```
